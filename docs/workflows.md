Yes, you can set up a GitHub Action that triggers a `docker-compose up` in your own server whenever there's a push to your GitHub repository. The general approach to achieve this involves having your GitHub Action communicate with your server, usually via SSH, to pull the latest codebase and execute the Docker commands.

### Prerequisites:
- Your server should have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- You need to have SSH access to your server.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### 1. SSH Key Setup
- Generate an SSH key pair (if you haven’t done this already) and add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your server.
- Add the private key to your GitHub repository as a secret (let’s call it `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`) to use it in the GitHub Action.

#### 2. GitHub Action Workflow
Create a GitHub Action workflow YAML file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that defines the deployment process.

Here’s a sample workflow that you can use as a reference:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust with your default branch if not main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to server
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}
        username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        script: |
          cd services/rockin_webapp.git
          git pull origin main  # Make sure the branch name matches your default branch
          docker-compose down
          docker-compose pull
          docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### 3. GitHub Secrets Setup
Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository to securely store sensitive information:
- `SERVER_IP`: IP address of your server.
- `SERVER_USERNAME`: Username used to SSH into your server.
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The SSH private key that corresponds to the public key added to your server.

### Explanation of the GitHub Action Workflow:
- **Checkout Code**: This step checks out your code into the GitHub Action runner.
  
- **Deploy to Server**: This step uses `appleboy/ssh-action` to SSH into your server and execute the defined script:
  - Navigate to your project directory.
  - Pull the latest code from the repository.
  - Run `docker-compose` commands to stop, rebuild, and start your containers.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the SSH user has sufficient permissions to run Docker commands or use `sudo` if necessary (and ensure that it doesn’t require a password prompt for simplicity).
- Make sure your Docker Compose file and application are configured to handle zero-downtime deployments if your use case cannot afford to be offline for a few seconds during the deploy process.
- Ensure the branch names in the GitHub Action match your working branches.
- Test the GitHub Action on a non-production server first to ensure it functions as expected.

With this setup, every push to the designated branch will trigger this GitHub Action, which will then deploy your updated code to the server by running the Docker Compose commands.

Yes, you can certainly use a domain name instead of an IP address when referring to the server in the GitHub Actions workflow. When the SSH client tries to establish a connection, it will resolve the domain name to an IP address using DNS.

Here's how you would modify the GitHub Action workflow using a domain name:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Adjust with your default branch if not main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to server
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.SERVER_DOMAIN }}
        username: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USERNAME }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        script: |
          cd /path/to/your/project
          git pull origin main  # Make sure the branch name matches your default branch
          docker-compose down
          docker-compose pull
          docker-compose up -d --build
```

In the above GitHub Action configuration:

- Replace `${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }}` with `${{ secrets.SERVER_DOMAIN }}`.
  
And in your GitHub Secrets:

- Replace `SERVER_IP` with `SERVER_DOMAIN` and set its value to your domain name (e.g., `mydomain.com`).

This modification assumes that your domain is correctly set up to resolve to your server’s IP address and that SSH access is configured to accept connections via that domain. Ensure the domain points to the correct server IP and that there are no DNS issues before relying on this in your deployment pipeline to prevent any disruptions.
