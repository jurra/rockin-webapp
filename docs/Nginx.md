1. **Global Configuration**:
   - `worker_processes 1;`: This tells `nginx` to run one worker process. For a single-core server, this is typical.

2. **Events Block**:
   - `worker_connections 1024;`: This indicates how many simultaneous connections each worker process can handle. So, with the above configuration, the server can handle up to 1024 concurrent connections.

3. **HTTP Block**:
   - This is the main block where all the HTTP and server configurations are specified.

4. **Upstream Block**:
   - `upstream app_servers { server web:5000; }`: Defines a group of servers. Here, requests will be passed to the server `web` on port `5000`. The name `app_servers` is used later to proxy requests to this upstream.

5. **Server Block (Port 80)**:
   - `listen 80 default_server;`: The server listens on port 80 (HTTP) and is the default server for this port.
   - `location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }`: Any HTTP request (port 80) to this server gets redirected (301) to its HTTPS (port 443) counterpart.

6. **Server Block (Port 443)**:
   - This block configures the HTTPS server.
   - `listen 443 ssl http2;`: The server listens on port 443 with SSL enabled and HTTP/2 support.
   - SSL Certificate configurations are specified, e.g., `ssl_certificate`, `ssl_certificate_key`, etc.
   - The `ssl_session_*` directives are related to SSL session caching for performance.
   - `ssl_protocols` and `ssl_ciphers` define which SSL/TLS versions and ciphers the server should use.
   - `add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;`: This enables HSTS, which tells browsers to always use HTTPS.
   - OCSP stapling improves SSL performance by allowing the server to store SSL certificate status and serve it to clients.
   
7. **Location Blocks**:
   - `location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { ... }`: This block is for Let's Encrypt certificate challenges. When Let's Encrypt validates your server, it will look for challenge files in this location.
   - The main `location /` block:
     - `proxy_pass http://app_servers;`: All incoming requests are proxied (forwarded) to the upstream named `app_servers` defined earlier.
     - `proxy_set_header` directives: These ensure that certain headers are set or modified when proxying the request, which can be helpful or necessary for the upstream application (e.g., to know the real IP address of the client).

In summary, this `nginx` configuration sets up a server to listen on ports 80 and 443, redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and then proxies HTTPS requests to an upstream server (likely your app) running at `web:5000`. Additionally, it's set up to handle Let's Encrypt SSL certificate challenges.
